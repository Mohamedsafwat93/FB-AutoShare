⚠️ FACEBOOK APP NAME ISSUE

The problem: Posts show "Published by CreatorSolutions" instead of "IT-Solutions Page"

This is because Facebook displays the APP NAME when posts are created via API, 
not the PAGE NAME.

SOLUTION - Change Facebook App Name:

1. Go to https://developers.facebook.com/apps/
2. Select your app (CreatorSolutions)
3. Settings > Basic
4. Change "App Name" to "IT-Solutions" (or remove CreatorSolutions branding)
5. Save changes

After changing the app name, new posts will show:
"Published by IT-Solutions"

ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION (if app name cannot be changed):
- The app name is metadata that helps identify the tool/service
- It's normal for API posts to show the app creator
- This is a Facebook UX limitation, not a code issue
